<h2># Introduction</h2>

<p>Hello and thanks for reading this file! This file will show you everything we have in mind for this project about a quiz, and also some more extras!</p>

<h2># Our Goal</h2>

<p>This project has as it's main goal to make a quiz on an android enviroment with the resource of "Android Studio" in order to test our users knowledge, make some fun tests, get little competitions within our userbase or just for them to have a little fun! In order to achieve this, we used and are still using the programming language "JAVA" for the code itself, with some touch of HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT in order to create a little introductory website. In the future, we are also planning to make a highly improved website to maybe show our uses. With this project, we hope to bring some fun to our users and improve our as much as possible our capabilities in this area.
<br>
At the moment, we are converting the android app according to the MVVM model, in order to achieve better organization, flow and improve the project in general. We are also at the moment creating a develoaped website to make the CRUD operations in the app, like editing or deleting a question, for example (this website is not the introductory website we created, that one was very simple). 
<br>
You can find that project's development here: https://github.com/JustaStudent01/PootisQuiz 
</p>

<h2># Improvements</h2>

<p>This quiz is some sort of "upgrade" to our lattest project, which was the same exact idea, but on console with less features and less organized (using the free java development environment designed for beginners BlueJ). 
   <br>
   It is available on another repository, which is this one if you want to check out: https://github.com/JustaStudent01/QuizConsoleApp. With this new project, we hope to improve some features and even add some more, create a good interface for the app, add a multiplayer gamemode, have a better login/accounts system (with password encryptation, for example), make the app more rewarding, etc.</p>

<h2># Programs used</h2>

<p>GitHub, Android Studio, VisualStudioCode, ROOM database (SQLite), Adobe Ilustrator, Github Desktop</p>

<h2># Roadmap</h2>

<p>Here are the order of the steps we are taking to develoap this application:</p>

<p>1. Analyse the problem</p>
<p>2. Order the tasks to do among the members and find the solution to the problem</p>
<p>3. Begin to solve the problem and add features</p>
<p>4. Use the tools available in order to improve the task solving</p>
<p>5. Organize the app based on the design pattern "Model View View-Model" for better organization </p>
<p>6. Give some quality of life improvements to the project (bugs or simple features)</p>
<p>7. (...)</p>
